# AndroidPhotoAnnotation

A simple photo annotation app for Android

### Background

This app works by allowing the user to take a photo (in dev mode this will access the computer camera) and subsequently annotate the app using different
width brushes. You can also toggle to erase certain annotations, or reset the annotation completely (leaving just the picture).

I used the below tutorials for help on some of the details:
- [Canvas Drawing](https://google-developer-training.github.io/android-developer-advanced-course-practicals/unit-5-advanced-graphics-and-views/lesson-11-canvas/11-1b-p-draw-on-a-canvas/11-1b-p-draw-on-a-canvas.html)
- [SeekBars](https://abhiandroid.com/ui/seekbar)

Make sure to have the latest Java installed, download Android Studio, and run the Gradle build before running the app.

Enjoy!
